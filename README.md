Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

Known Issues:

*** Please kindly note that this plane from MSFS has numerous unselectable switches. This is a MSFS model/featureset issue, not a YC's or the Profile I created issue.

FIXED:
- Initial release 8/24/2024 no feedback yet

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
